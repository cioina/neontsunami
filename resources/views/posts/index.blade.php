  <p class="lead">I like to document the things I learn, problems I come across and solve and thoughts about most things web related. My blog posts range usually within the realms of PHP and Ruby, with a focus on Laravel 4 and Ruby On Rails. They go into awesome new or not-well-known features of these frameworks as well as discussing some real world approaches to web development. I'm interested in developing, testing, deploying and scaling.</p>
  <p>If there's something you'd like me to write about, shoot me a tweet.</p>

      <strong>Oops!</strong> There are no posts yet, please come back soon for more content.

    @each('posts._post', $posts, 'post')
