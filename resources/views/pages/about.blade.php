  <p class="lead">I'm a web developer based in <strong>Sydney, Australia</strong> with a keen interest in frameworks like <a href="http://laravel.com/" title="Laravel">Laravel</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby On Rails</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/" title="AngularJS">AngularJS</a>. I manage a number of high-traffic websites and apps including <a href="https://studentvip.com.au">StudentVIP</a>, <a href="https://lostoncampus.com.au">Lost On Campus</a> and <a href="https://www.timetableexchange.com.au">Timetable Exchange</a>. I also enjoy contributing to and maintaining my own <a href="https://github.com/dwightwatson">open-source projects</a>.</p>

  <p>I built this blog to document some of the interesting problems I deal with in my day to day work as a web developer, as well as showcase the solutions and packages I've built to solve common issues. I've released the source code for this blog as an <a href="https://github.com/dwightwatson/neontsunami">open source repository</a> to assist others in looking how a fully fleshed &amp; tested Laravel app comes together and I'm particularly proud of <a href="https://github.com/dwightwatson/validating">my validating package</a>.</p>
